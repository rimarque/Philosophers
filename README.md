# **Philosophers**

## :speech_balloon: **About**
This project is about solving the dining philosophers problem, using threads. 
The philosopher's problem is a synchronization problem where multiple philosophers sit at a table with limited resources. 
They alternate between thinking, sleeping and eating, but must avoid deadlock and starvation by coordinating their actions to prevent conflicts over shared resources.
Coded in C.

## :inbox_tray: **Cloning the repository**

```shell
git clone git@github.com:rimarque/Philosophers.git 
```

## üíé **Features**
```
- Each philosopher is a thread
- There are as many forks as philosophers, one between each pair of philosophers
- Every forks state is protected with a mutex
- A philosopher takes their right and left forks to eat
- Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve
- Philosophers don¬¥t communicate with each other
- When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again.
- Number of philosophers, time it takes for a philosopher to die of starvation,
time it takes a philosopher to eat and time a philosopher spends sleeping are taken as an argument
- There is an optional argument: number of times a philosopher should eat
- The simulation stops when all philosopher have eaten the number of times specified.
If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.

## :link: **Compilation**
To compile the program you should run `make`.

This rule will generate an executable file named `philo`. To launch the executable you should follow this syntax:

```sh
$ ./philo <n_philo> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> <OPCIONAL(n_eat)>
```
### Lets test for an even number of philosofers! 
If you establish a time to die that equal or greater than double the time_to_eat plus 10 (for tolerance), the philosopher will never starv and the simulation will never stop:
```sh
$ ./philo 12 410 200 200
```
Time to die that must also be equal or greater than the sum of time_to_eat plus time_to_sleep plus 10 (for tolerance). Otherwise the philosopher will starv:
```sh
$ ./philo 12 410 200 210
```
### Lets test for an odd number of philosofers!
